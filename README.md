# Microsoft-30-day-challenge

# Purpose

I hope to develop an approach and mentality through this challenge that will enable me to do research, solve problems, and record findings as a SOC analyst. This project details my work in setting up Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, and Entra ID in a Microsoft SOC lab from the ground up.

# Project Overview

The project is divided in four modules for a period of 30-days. Using actual Microsoft security tools, this challenge aims to demonstrate what a contemporary cloud SOC analyst does.
