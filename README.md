# Microsoft-30-day-challenge

# Purpose

In this 30-Day challenge using a purely Microsoft-based environment, I showcase what I've learned in the progress days, as well as demonstrate with the steps and screenshots attached the knowledge and skills I'm acquiring through this project. Through this process I'am pursuing goals like gain real experience in a SOC environment with Microsoft-based tools, adding a new project in my portfolio, to acquire a methodology for research, and "think like an analyst" when doing an investigation.
