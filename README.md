# Microsoft-30-day-challenge

# Purpose

In this Microsoft challenge, I showcase what I've learned in a 30-days progress. The procedure, tasks, and screenshots on this project show the knowledge, and skills I'm learning to grow in my career. 


# Project Overview

The project is divided in four modules for a period of 30-days. Using actual Microsoft security tools, this challenge aims to demonstrate what a contemporary cloud SOC analyst does. 
From my own lab setting, I will look into phishing emails, identify malicious activity, look for dangers, and prepare incident reports.
