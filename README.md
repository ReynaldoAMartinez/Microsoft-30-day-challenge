The project is divided in four modules for a period of 30-days. Using actual Microsoft security tools, this challenge aims to demonstrate what a contemporary cloud SOC analyst does. 
From my own lab setting, I will look into phishing emails, identify malicious activity, look for dangers, and prepare incident reports.
