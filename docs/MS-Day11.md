# Threat Policies (Email & Collaboration) — Simple Explanations
These policies control how email is protected from things like phishing, malware, scams, and impersonation. There are usually six main threat policies in this section.

# **1. TEMPLATE POLICIES**

**Think of templates as “pre-made security setups” you can apply quickly.**

They give you recommended settings built by Microsoft. You don't enforce them directly — you use them to create real policies. **In short:** Templates = **“default recommended security setups”** you can use to create your actual policies.

# **2. POLICIES**

**Policies are the real security rules that you apply to devices or users.**

They control how Defender behaves on machines.

**In short:** Policies = **“your actual security settings”** applied to users or machines.

# **3. RULES**

**Rules are more specific, detailed instructions inside certain features.**

They tell Defender *exactly* what to block, allow, or detect.

**In short:** Rules = **“specific instructions”** inside a policy that say exactly what action to take.
