This day I learned that Microsoft Sentinel allows options ingest and centralize logs, create custom detections, and run automated workflows using the next options:
"Logs" to run queries (pre-built), and there are two modes to run those queries: simple mode, and KQL mode.
"Configuration / Analytics" to create my own detection rules.
"Configuration / Automation" to create automation rules than can act as playbooks.
"Threat management / Incidents" to create incidents based on alerts defined in the anlytics page.
"Threat management / Workbooks" to build dashboards & visualizations.
