# Day 14 - Learned about two of most important tools to investigate email threats: Explorer and Quarantine.

Explorer is a powerful tool that lets me search through mail flow activity so I can answer questions like:

- **Who received a specific email?**
- **Was it blocked, delivered, or clicked?**
- **Was it detected by Safe Links or anti-phishing?**

Explorer shows emails by categories and allows to search by specific fields such as Sender address, Recipients, Subject, and more.
